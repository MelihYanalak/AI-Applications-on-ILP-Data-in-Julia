# AI-Applications-on-ILP-Data-in-Julia
Firstly, a large data set consisting of Integer Linear Programming examples is created. Then Deep Neural Network approach is used in order to decide which algorithm to be used while optimizing Integer Linear Programming examples in Julia programming language by using JuMP Framework. 

Details about the project can be accessed by the Report pdf file inside the repository.
